● Managers and chef have an authorization to change menu details for the particular day.

● Waiters are provided with a working system in a tablet where they can manually enter the order details with the respective table number.

● The order details once submitted by the waiter will automatically get updated in manager system and also in the chef system.

● The details can be changed by the manager and chef on request of the customer.

● Billing for the respective table is automatically generated by the system, which allows the customers to pay with either cash, card or Paypal.

● The details of every employeer with their order details, billing status gets stored in the database which can be throughly reviewed when needed.

● The application has an option where the customer can give feedback to the restaurant in the form of reviews and ratings, which enables the manager to change the functionaliies based on the reviews submitted by the users.
